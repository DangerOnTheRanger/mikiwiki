MikiWiki - a simple wiki written in Python
==========================================


MikiWiki is a simple wiki system in one (somewhat sloppy) Python file. It even has Markdown support!


Prerequisites
-------------

Python - tested with 2.7, but 2.6 should work as well.
No dependencies on any libraries not found within the standard library!


Running MikiWiki
----------------

Stick MikiWiki in a folder somewhere, start up `miki.sh` or `miki.bat`, and point your browser to http://localhost:8000.
